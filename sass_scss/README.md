## Introduction

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It provides variables, nested rules, and mixins, which help to keep stylesheets well-organized and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). SCSS is the syntax of Sass that is most similar to CSS and is often preferred by developers for its familiarity.
